For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

a method that returns the sum of two integers



Ask for the input of two integers
save each integer to a variable
add the two variables together
save result of addition to a variable
print result

START

GET integer 1 from user
SET integer1 = first integer input

GET integer 2 from user
SET integer2 = second integer input

SET sum = add integer 1 plus integer 2

PRINT sum

END



a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together


START

given array of strings

SET variable = new_array that is all strings concatenated together

GET each string
separate each string from the array

combine each string into one string via concatentation

PRINT new_array

END



a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

START

We have an array of integers
Separate out every other integer
Puts separated integers into a new array
Print results--the new array


START

#Given an array of integers called awesome_integers

SET new array called better_integers = blank

GET every other integer from awesome_integers

SAVE into better_integers array

PRINT new array

END
